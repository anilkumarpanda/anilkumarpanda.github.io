title: Error Analysis for Tabular Data - Part 2

In this post we will explore the Residual Analysis method for model debugging.

I will adapt the Residual analysis method from [this](https://nbviewer.org/github/jphall663/GWU_rml/blob/master/lecture_5.ipynb) repo.

** Residual Analysis **

Residuals refer to the difference between the recorded value of a dependent variable and the predicted value of a dependent variable for every row in a data set. Plotting the residual values against the predicted values is a time-honored model assessment technique and a great way to see all your modeling results in two dimensions.

To be continued..
