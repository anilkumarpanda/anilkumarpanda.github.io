title: MultiObjective Optimisation with Genetic Algorithm !
---
For most of the problems in real world, we have to optimise on two or more functions .
Eg in the case of machine learning problems we mat have to optimise on two or more objective functions
like  maximise accuracy vs increase interpretability . Almost always these objective functions will be
orthogonal to each other
