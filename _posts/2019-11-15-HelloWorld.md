Hello there, this is my personal blog to note down my thoughts both personal and professional .
I plan to write about technology, the books I have read, the side project I am working on etc .
I also plan to share my ideas freely here, so that others can discuss it with me and contribute as well .

You too can create your own blog website, following instructions from [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
