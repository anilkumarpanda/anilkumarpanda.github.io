title: MultiObjective Optimisation with Genetic Algorithm !
---
For most of the problems in real world, we have to optimise on two or more objective functions .
Eg in the case of machine learning problems we may have to optimise on two or more objective function like  maximise accuracy vs increase interpretability . Almost always these objective functions will be
orthogonal to each other.

There are nulptiple ways to solve Mutliobjective problems, however in this post we will focus a specific
algorithm called NGSA II ( Non Dominatated sorting using Genetic Algorithm) .
There is a excellent lecture series you can follow [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm2LK4vJzRw) for the theory and examples. I will focus here on the pratical application and esp in the field of machine learning .


Before we go ahead, let us learn the basic building blocks of Genetic algorithms and Pareto Optimisation .

1. __Genetic algorithm__ : It is an optimisation technique, that relies on two major principles.
a.Diversity Preservation
b.Selection pressure
Follow the lectures [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_8MpZeMdD4&t=6s) for an amazing introduction .

2. __Pareto Solutions__ : A set of solutions to an multi objective problem, is said to be a Pareto optimal solution if it is better in atleast one objective without it being worse for the other .
3. __Pareto Front__ : A set of all Pareto optimal solutions are called as Pareto Front .

NSGA-II approach combines both the above principles to provide solutions to an Multiobjective problem .

Some of the scenarios where MOGA can used inlcude:

1. Reduce complexity of our ML solution but increase/decrease the selected metric (accuracy,roc-auc, precision, recall) etc.
