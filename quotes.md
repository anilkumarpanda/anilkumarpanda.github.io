I have always liked to collect quotes. Here is a collection of my favourite quotes.

### *Hamming, Richard  The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn*

On having a vision

> It is well known the drunken sailor who staggers to the left or right with $ {n} $ independent random steps will,on the average, end up about $ \sqrt{n} $ steps from the origin.
> But if there is a pretty girl in one direction, then his steps will tend to go in that direction and he will go a distance proportional to $ {n} $.
> 
> In a lifetime of many, many independent choices, small and large, a career with a vision will get you a distance proportional to n, while no vision will get you only the distance .
> *In a sense, the main difference between those who go far and those who do not is some people have a vision and the others do not and therefore can only react to the current events as they happen.* 

On looking at the larger picture

>I strongly recommend taking the time, on a regular basis, to ask the larger questions, and not stay immersed in the sea of detail where almost everyone stays almost all of the time.

On working to hone your skills

>I had to establish the reputation on my own time that I could do important work, and only then was I given the time to do it. 
>You do not hire a plumber to learn plumbing while trying to fix your trouble; you expect he is already an expert.
