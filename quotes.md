I have always liked to collect quotes. Here is a collection of my favourite quotes.

#### *Hamming, Richard The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn*

> It is well known the drunken sailor who staggers to the left or right with n independent random steps will,on the average, end up about \sqrt{n} steps from the origin.
> But if there is a pretty girl in one direction, then his steps will tend to go in that direction and he will go a distance proportional to n.
> In a lifetime of many, many independent choices, small and large, a career with a vision will get you a distance proportional to n, while no vision will get you only the distance .
> In a sense, the main difference between those who go far and those who do not is some people have a vision and the others do not and therefore can only react to the current events as they happen.
